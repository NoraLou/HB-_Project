###Overview

  digiTate is an Art History exploration app based on open source data from Londonâ€™s Tate museum.  This responsive one-page app, offers users a playful, intuitive way to visually explore artworks from the 16th to 20th century. The custom navigation system was created in an inventive "fan" layout structure that allows users to visually browse a massive image set quickly.  The data model was carefully crafted to reflect the complex relationships between historical periods, cultural movements, individual artists, and artworks, and to optimize the quick availability of data on the front-end. Ajax allows users to seamlessly browse images and quickly drill-down into related topics to rapidly grasp the historical and cultural context of an artwork and discover new connections.
